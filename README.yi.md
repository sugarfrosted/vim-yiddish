Dependencies: For normal usage require `+arabic` or at least `+rightleft` , which is included in Vim compiled with `--with-features=huge` and `--with-features=big`. In order to use custom composition lists the possible dependencies are: Compiled with Python Support (2.7), the program `uconv`, or any installation of `python2.7`(by default uses the program named `python2.7` to select another name or to use a complete path modify `let g:python27location="<location>"`, 2.6 should also work, but is untested.) 

Apple's terminal does not appear compatible with right to left characters in vim, as it displays characters based on their unicode direction. For a replacement I recommend [iTerm2](http://iTerm2.com). 

Install with pathogen by cloning into your bundle folder.

To access set the shortcuts for toggling language and to compose characters use the command
`:YiddishSC` after startup or add `let g:YiddishEnabled = 1` (must be set prior to startup)
to your .vimrc file. Non-standard mappings can be assigned to `g:YiddishKeys` as a list, (of the form [char1, char2, ..., charn]). A single can
be assigned a string and multiple as a list of strings. For them to take effect `YiddishSC`
must be called again. Tested on Vim compiled with the `--with-features=huge` option, with
and without python support.
